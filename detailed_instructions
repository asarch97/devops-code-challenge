The building and testing process was run on EC2

sudo su
cd /
mkdir -p usr/src/app
chown -R ubuntu /usr/src/app

download a zip from github, extract and copy files.


install docker
---------------
apt-get update
apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release

Add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key:
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

set up the repository
 echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] \
  https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin

apt-get install docker-compose-plugin
apt-get install docker-compose


verify
sudo docker run hello-world


install npm
-----------
apt install npm
a screen comes up showing services using the old libraries
go ahead and restart them


for testing purposes
open ports 8080 and 3000 on the ec2


build the docker images
-----------------------
cd /usr/src/app/backend
docker build -t node-image .

cd /usr/src/app/frontend
docker build -t dock-image .


test on ec2
-----------
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose down

note: for the communication to work, had to change the localhost settings in config files to the dns name for ec2.



register the images on AWS
--------------------------
services -> Elastic Container registry

create repository
visibility: private
name: docker-repo

uri of the repository
880651758906.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/docker-repo


create repository
visibility: private
name: noderepo

uri of the repository
880651758906.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/noderepo


login
------
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 880651758906.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com


tag and push the images
-----------------------
docker tag dock-image 880651758906.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/docker-repo
docker push 880651758906.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/docker-repo

docker tag node-image 880651758906.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/noderepo
docker push 880651758906.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/noderepo


find the docker image uri
-------------------------
in ECR
click on the repository name
it will show the docker images
copy uri for the latest image

880651758906.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/docker-repo:latest
880651758906.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/noderepo:latest

create a role for running containers
------------------------------------
in IAM

new role
aws service
use cases for other aws services
select elastic container service
elastic container service task
role name: ecs_role

gave following permissions:
AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess	
AmazonECS_FullAccess
AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy

get the dns names for the load balancers

reactlb-2088109173.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
nodelb-2016202280.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com


change the two config files:

backend/config.js 
    CORS_ORIGIN: 'http://reactlb-2088109173.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com'

frontend/src/config.js
export const API_URL = 'http://nodelb-2016202280.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com'


rebuild and redploy the images
in the cluster
go under the tasks tab
stop the two running tasks
the services will autimatically provision new tasks.

once the tasks are running, try the following url:

http://reactlb-2088109173.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com

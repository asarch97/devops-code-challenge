The deployment consists of two services with dockers, one for nodejs and one for react. Two load balancers
were deployed to send the requests to the services. The dns names for the load balancers were used for routing
the requests.

For simplicity, one VPC was used without any subnetting. Both services are publicly accesible.

CI/CD

I have put things in place for CI/CD on the react component. Built my code pipeline, put in buildspec.yml in frontend, Dockerfile at the root level. 
Made one simple change to frontend/src/App.js - the fetching message that appears at the beginning. It goes by so quick that its hard to see, but it is there. You can make another change that is more visible. The build and deploy process is taking about 10 to 15 minutes.

 

An additional deployment on Kubernettes
Deployed the backend on Google Kubernettes Engine. 
The endpoint is:  34.94.218.191:8080
